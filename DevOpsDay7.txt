There is a pattern in the playbooks
- upper level info
- get dependencies
- get GPG key
- create directory for package
- install package
- optional check status


Playbooks that are already created that you call would be called roles. 

 cd /etc/ansible/
 mkdir roles
 cd roles/
 defaults  
 handlers  
 meta  
 tasks  
 tests  
 vars
 
default: playbooks that are always run
handlers: 
meta:
tasks: maintained in tasks folders
tests: - tools that can be leveraged
vars: 

To run playbooks, you pass a variable.
